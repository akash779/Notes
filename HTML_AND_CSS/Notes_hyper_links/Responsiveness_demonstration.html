    <p1>
        Website responsiveness refers to the ability of a website to adapt and display appropriately on various devices and screen sizes, providing users with an optimal viewing and browsing experience. A responsive website ensures that the content, layout, and design elements dynamically adjust to fit different screen resolutions, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
